# Housing Scraper

A Python application that scrapes housing websites (only 1 for now), extracts relevant information from the data, and finally sends this information to the user. This application aims to give the user a competitive advantage over other people since adverts are usually launched in batches to signed-up users. With this app, you will get a new listing in less than a minute according to your preferences (by you, I mean me. This app is still not set up to be a multi-user application. Easy configuration must be implemented, as well as a multi-profile feature).
